This is a Capstone project, and this file is the raw data file in Zip from kaggle.com
Solar_farm_generation_plant.csv is the structured/clear up data
Task: Solar Farm Energy Production & Consumption (Energy/IoT) 
Data Source: 
â€¢ Simulated IoT CSV data or Kaggle Solar Power Generation Data 
Deliverables: 
1. ETL pipeline to process solar panel output and household consumption logs. 
2. Transformation logic for efficiency %, battery SOC, and peak hours. 
3. PostgreSQL schema for time-series solar data. 
4. Grafana dashboard with: 
a) Solar generation vs consumption chart. 
b) Efficiency % over time. 
c) Battery charge/discharge cycles.
